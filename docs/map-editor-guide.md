3. **Quick Color Switching**: Use the picker tool (K) to quickly grab colors from existing tiles
4. **Building Patterns**: Use the rectangle tool to quickly create building foundations
5. **Natural Caves**: Use larger brush sizes (5-8) for more natural-looking cave systems

## Saving Changes

- Changes are automatically saved to the document

## Switching Views

To switch back to the text editor:

- Or use VS Code's "Reopen With..." command

## Troubleshooting

### Map doesn't load
- Ensure the .dat file has valid syntax
- Check that tiles section exists and is properly formatted

### Colors look wrong
- The editor uses standard tile colors from the game
- Custom tiles get auto-generated colors based on their ID

### Performance issues
- Try reducing brush size for better performance
- Very large maps (200x200+) may have some lag

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:
- Copy/paste tile regions
- Tile stamps and patterns
- Mirror/rotate tools
- Multi-layer editing
- Export to image formats
