briefingsuccess{
*Chief's jaw drops*

CADET... did you just clear an entire cavern of Rock Monsters using only a Sonic Blaster and sheer determination?

I've been doing this for 20 years and I've never seen anything like that. You're either incredibly skilled or incredibly lucky.

Either way, mission accomplished! The dozers can move in tomorrow.

```
# Objective was 100 crystals
briefingsuccess{
