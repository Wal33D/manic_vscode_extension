# Phase 2 Summary - Core Language Features

## Overview
Phase 2 focused on implementing comprehensive language features for the Manic Miners DAT file VSCode extension, transforming it from a basic syntax highlighter into a full-featured development environment.

## Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced Syntax Highlighting ✅
- Comprehensive TextMate grammar with semantic coloring
- Section-specific highlighting for all 17 DAT file sections
- Color-coded tile IDs based on their type (ground, wall, hazard, etc.)
- Syntax highlighting for script commands, variables, and events
- Proper highlighting for entity types, coordinates, and properties

### 2. Advanced Hover Information ✅
- **Comprehensive hover provider** (`src/hoverProvider.ts`)
  - Section descriptions with detailed explanations
  - Field-specific information with constraints and examples
  - Tile ID descriptions showing name, category, and properties
  - Entity type information (buildings, vehicles, creatures)
  - Script command documentation with syntax examples
  - Coordinate component explanations (X, Y, Z, P, R)
  - Rich markdown formatting for better readability

### 3. Context-Aware IntelliSense ✅
- **Enhanced completion provider** (`src/completionItemProvider.ts`)
  - Section-aware completions that only show relevant suggestions
  - Snippet templates for complex structures (coordinates, objectives)
  - Tile ID suggestions with descriptions in tiles/height sections
  - Entity type completions with full coordinate templates
  - Script command completions with parameter placeholders
  - Info field completions with all available options

### 4. Code Snippets ✅
- **Comprehensive snippet collection** (`snippets/manicminers.code-snippets`)
  - Basic level template with all required sections
  - Section-specific snippets (info, tiles, objectives, etc.)
  - Entity snippets for buildings, vehicles, and creatures
  - Script snippets for events, variables, and commands
  - Helper snippets for common patterns (tile rows, resource grids)
  - Over 25 snippets covering all common use cases

### 5. Navigation Features ✅
- **Go-to-Definition Provider** (`src/definitionProvider.ts`)
  - Jump to section definitions
  - Navigate from entity references to their declarations
  - Find event definitions from event calls
  - Locate variable definitions from usage
  
- **Find References Provider** (`src/referenceProvider.ts`)
  - Find all references to entities (buildings, vehicles, creatures)
  - Locate all event calls for a specific event
  - Find all usages of script variables
  - Section reference tracking

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- All TypeScript strict mode checks pass
- ESLint rules enforced (no-any, no-unused-vars, etc.)
- Prettier formatting applied consistently
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new features

### Testing
- 52 tests covering all new functionality
- Mock VSCode API for unit testing
- Parser tests for DAT file processing
- Provider tests for all language features

### Documentation
- Inline code documentation with JSDoc
- Comprehensive hover documentation for users
- Type definitions for all DAT file structures

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Intuitive Development**: Developers can now write DAT files with full IDE support
2. **Learning Aid**: Hover information teaches the file format as users work
3. **Faster Development**: Snippets and completions speed up file creation
4. **Error Prevention**: Context-aware suggestions prevent invalid syntax
5. **Easy Navigation**: Jump between related code sections quickly

## Next Steps (Phase 3 Recommendations)

1. **Advanced Analysis**
   - Real-time validation with error squiggles
   - Code actions for quick fixes
   - Unused entity detection
   
2. **Visualization**
   - Preview command for tile layout
   - Minimap visualization
   - Color picker for tile selection
   
3. **Refactoring Tools**
   - Rename support for entities and variables
   - Extract section refactoring
   - Format document command

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully transformed the Manic Miners DAT extension from a basic syntax highlighter into a comprehensive development environment. The extension now provides professional-grade language support including IntelliSense, hover information, snippets, and navigation features. All features are thoroughly tested and documented, making the extension ready for production use.
