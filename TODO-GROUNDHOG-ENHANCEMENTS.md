- [ ] Add performance impact warnings for complex scripts

**Impact**: Prevent common scripting errors and improve script reliability.

### 3. Golden File Testing System
**Goal**: Implement groundhog's golden file testing approach for map validation.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create golden file test framework for map generation
- [ ] Add test maps for each validation scenario

**Impact**: Enable easier script generation and modification tools.

### 5. Map Statistics and Analysis
**Goal**: Provide comprehensive map analysis like groundhog's validation.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Calculate tile distribution statistics
- [ ] Analyze resource density and distribution
- [ ] Implement accessibility scoring with flood-fill
- [ ] Add difficulty estimation based on parameters
- [ ] Create visual heatmaps for resources/hazards
- [ ] Generate balance reports

**Impact**: Help map creators understand and balance their levels.

### 6. Template/Architect System
**Goal**: Implement reusable map patterns inspired by groundhog's architect system.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create template interface for map sections
- [ ] Implement basic templates (spawn area, resource cache, combat arena)
- [ ] Add template composition system
- [ ] Create template parameter customization
- [ ] Add template preview in welcome page
- [ ] Implement template insertion commands

**Impact**: Speed up map creation with proven design patterns.

## üìä Lower Priority Enhancements

**Goal**: Upgrade map preview to show different data layers.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add toggleable layers (tiles, height, resources, hazards)
- [ ] Implement resource yield visualization
- [ ] Show accessibility regions with different colors
- [ ] Add spawn point indicators
- [ ] Display path connections between areas
- [ ] Create minimap overview

**Impact**: Better visualization for map design decisions.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add wave-based spawner patterns
- [ ] Implement resource bank patterns (blackout scenario)
- [ ] Create air supply monitoring patterns
- [ ] Add multi-stage boss fight templates
- [ ] Implement dynamic difficulty adjustment patterns
- [ ] Create pan/focus camera control snippets

**Impact**: Provide more sophisticated scripting options.

### 9. Batch Validation Tools
**Goal**: Process multiple maps with comprehensive reporting.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create batch validation command
- [ ] Generate summary reports for map sets
- [ ] Add common error tracking
- [ ] Export validation results as JSON
- [ ] Create validation rule customization
- [ ] Add campaign-wide consistency checks

**Impact**: Useful for validating entire campaigns or map packs.
